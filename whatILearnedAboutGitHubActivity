1.We've been talking about GitHub and how it relates to R/R Studio. What is your takeaway from today's class?
  I think I am still a bit confused about how github works. I think it would be good to watch examples of other people doing these things, so that I can see it happen. 
 
2. What is one question that you still have ?
   Will we be doing more practive with the steps of github and go through things as a class?
